Here's a **complete summary and notes** for your phishing URL detection tool project:

## 🔐 **Phishing URL Detection Tool – Summary & Notes**

---

### ✅ **Project Purpose**

This tool is built to **detect whether a given URL is phishing or legitimate**, using machine learning. The user enters a URL, and the tool analyzes its features to predict whether it's safe or malicious.

---

### 🧠 **How It Works**

#### 1. **Training Phase** (Offline - Done Before Deployment)

* **Script**: `train_model.py`
* **Inputs**:

  * Dataset: `phishing_dataset.csv`
  * Feature extraction from each URL
* **Process**:

  * URLs are preprocessed using logic in `preprocess.py`
  * Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
  * Model training using a `RandomForestClassifier`
* **Output**:

  * Trained model: `phishing_model.pkl`
  * Scaler: `scaler.pkl`

---

#### 2. **Prediction Phase** (Online - Real-Time Using Flask App)

* **Script**: `app.py`
* **How it works**:

  * The user inputs a URL in the web interface (`index.html`)
  * Flask receives the input and passes it to the `extract_features` function (from `url_feature_extraction.py`)
  * The extracted features are scaled and passed to the model
  * The prediction is returned: “✅ Legitimate” or “🚨 Phishing”

### 🧾 **Key Python Files Overview**

#### `train_model.py`

* Reads data, processes URLs into numerical features.
* Trains a model using Scikit-learn.
* Saves the trained model (`.pkl`) and scaler.

#### `preprocess.py`

* Contains `load_and_preprocess_data()` used only in training.

#### `url_feature_extraction.py`

* Contains `extract_features(url)` used during prediction.
* Features include:

  * URL length
  * Presence of `@`, `https`, IP address
  * Count of digits, dots, slashes, special characters
  * Suspicious keywords (like "login", "bank")

#### `app.py`

* Flask routes:

  * `/`: Home page with form
  * `/predict`: POST route to receive URL and return prediction
* Uses `joblib` to load model and scaler.

### 💻 **How to Run Locally**

1. **Install Requirements**

```bash
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn
```

2. **Train the Model**

```bash
python train_model.py
```

3. **Run the Flask App**

```bash
python app.py
```

4. **Visit in Browser**

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)

* Add URL shortening detection (like bit.ly)
* Add backend database to store prediction history
* Improve UI with Bootstrap or Tailwind
* Add REST API endpoints (JSON response instead of HTML)
* Add real-time virus scanning via VirusTotal API
